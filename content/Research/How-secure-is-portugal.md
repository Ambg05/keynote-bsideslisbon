### How Secure is Portugal?

How secure and safe are Portuguese companies and infrastructures?

Portugal today is a very digital country, and most Portuguese companies are software companies. If you look at how they operate, all of them are in software and are controlled by software.

The question is, how secure are they? How safe are they? By 'secure', I mean how well can they sustain an attack? How well can they detect and react to a possible attack on their digital infrastructure? What is the probability of an attack happening in the short term?

Although these are contradictory concepts, my thesis is that Portugal is both highly insecure, and, for the moment, quite safe.

Portugal is safe is because there are not enough attackers targeting the current insecurities of the system. This will probably remain the case for the next couple of years. The problem is what happens after that, when the criminals improve their business models and start to focus on Portuguese assets.



The AppSec industry in Portugal is comparatively small. There are very few Portuguese companies with public AppSec teams. The market for security companies is small, and while there are a couple of interesting pen testing companies, you don't see a lot of activity in that space.

The creation of an AppSec infrastructure is a direct consequence of being attacked. After an attack, companies create AppSec teams and hire security experts. If anything, Portugal exports its security experts. I know a lot of great Portuguese AppSec and InfoSec specialists in the UK.

The problem is, security experts aren't being recruited to Portugal. At the moment, countries like the UK, that are more evolved in AppSec, are recruiting, but Portugal should be hiring AppSec talent.

The reality is the Portuguese AppSec industry isn't very mature. The question is, does Portugal want to be like the rest of Europe and get caught in the crossfire? Or does it want to be proactive, and create an industry which could become very powerful, very effective, and very profitable for Portugal, and could also help to secure Europe and help the world?


### Portugal Compromised
The bottom line is that Portugal's (Government, Companies, People) current defense model is based on the following assumptions:
    * A low number of attackers
    * A low level of skills of existing attackers
    * Unsophisticated business model of existing attackers

To be clear, Portuguese government agencies and companies say they **are secure**. This is not true. They are NOT secure, and have many high-risk vulnerabilities and exploitable assets. It is very important that we accept this fact so that we can find the necessary political, economic, educational, and social solutions. For now, "The Emperor has no clothes".

There are no silver bullets or easy solutions, and anyone who says so is a snake-oil merchant.
The ideas in this presentation are about making Portugal a player, rather than being played, and giving Portugal a chance to defend itself, and improve Portuguese society. The worst aspect of our status is that we are not prepared for what is coming next, in terms of AppSec.  Our response to terrorist incidents in the past shows how badly we respond as a society to security incidents for which we are not prepared.

If you don't believe that Portugal is insecure, then prove me wrong in your answers to the following questions:
* Where is the evidence of Security and AppSec practices?
* How big is the Cyber/App Security market in Portugal?
* How many threat models are created per week?
* How many lines of code are reviewed for security per week (aka 'security eyeballs')? (Bear in mind that secure code reviews are very different from normal code reviews).

The current Portuguese security model is based on 'Security Fairies magic pixie dust' (add pic). However, the good news is that we have lots of great InfoSec and AppSec talent in Portugal.
