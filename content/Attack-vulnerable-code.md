I want vulnerable apps and appliances that are plugged into the PT national network to be hacked within seconds.

These apps and appliances should be hacked by 'good guys' who are trying to help by fixing or by disabling as necessary.

Government should have a mandate to authorize hacking to vulnerable devices (computers, routes, IoT) and fix them. In a way, this mandate
is also 'given' by the manufacturer once they push apps/code that contain vulnerabilities. 

Insurance companies should support this initiative, especially for cases where something goes wrong and a device is 'bricked'.
